# React Game of Life

## Description
The Game of Life is a classic cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. Despite its name, it's not really a game in the traditional sense. Instead, it's a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. It serves as a fascinating example of emergent complexity in a simple set of rules.

## How it Works
The game is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead. At each step, the game evolves according to a set of rules:

1. **Birth:** A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
2. **Survival:** A live cell with two or three live neighbors remains alive.
3. **Death:** A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies from underpopulation, and a live cell with more than three live neighbors dies from overpopulation.

These simple rules give rise to complex patterns and behaviors, including gliders, blinkers, and other interesting structures.

## Implementation
This React app allows users to interact with the Game of Life by toggling cells on or off and observing how the pattern evolves over time. Users can start, stop, and reset the simulation.

## Repository Structure
The repository for this app contains the React codebase, including components for rendering the grid, and implementing the game logic. It also includes stylesheets for layout and design, as well as any additional assets required.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
